                <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                    <h3>A Game Born from Boredom</h3>
                        <p>Pickleball wasn’t invented in a high-tech sports lab; it was born on a summer afternoon in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Three dads—Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum—returned from golf to find their families bored and restless. With an old badminton court but no shuttlecocks, they improvised. They lowered the net, grabbed some ping-pong paddles, and found a perforated plastic ball. The goal was simple: create a game the whole family could play together.</p>
                    <h3>From Backyard Fun to Global Phenomenon</h3>
                        <p>What started as a backyard experiment quickly evolved. The founders created simple rules, heavily relying on badminton but with a key twist: the "two-bounce rule" and the "non-volley zone" (now famous as "The Kitchen") to prevent powerful smashes and keep the game accessible. Originally named after the "pickle boat" in crew racing (or perhaps the family dog, Pickles—the debate continues!), the sport quietly grew in community centers for decades. Today, it has exploded into the fastest-growing sport in America, proving that a game designed for fun and family can turn into a worldwide obsession.</p>

                <h2>How to Score</h2>
                
                    <h3>Traditional Side-Out Scoring</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Tournament games may be to 15 or 21, win by 2.</li>
                        <li>When the serving team's score is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) the player who was the first server in the game for that team will be in the right-side court when serving or receiving; when odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) that player will be in the left-side court when serving or receiving.</li>
                    </ul>
